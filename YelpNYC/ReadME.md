# The sole purpose of this project is for learning and also because I like going out to eat every now and then

Whats next?
---
* rewrite the some of the code so it will run faster(ie. passing the restaurants list instead of reading from file everytime)
* remove the black lines on the map that seperates the areas so it will look more seemless
* fix the entries in the DB to match that of the csv/restaurants list so that the colorize function can fill in the entire map
